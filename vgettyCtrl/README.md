# vgettyCtrl - PSTN Remote Control (DTMF) ServerGoal is a functional Answering Machine on PC (PSTN 56k Modem).See client application 'WOSHDialToneClient'.Last updated on 2009-09-30. Implemented in C.## DescriptionThis little project is mostly a proof of concept or a prototype.It's based on Linux and vgetty, management script is written for BASH (and VM shell from vgetty).When DTFM tones are detected, the script call an application (C++, QT) which evaluate codeand perform actions (XML configuration). There is also a Java ME (MIDP) application as front-end (of same XML data)for mobile phones (WOSHDialToneClient).So basically one can control PC/House sending encoded DTMF tones generated by a Java Midlet.Related Links:	* http://alpha.greenie.net/vgetty/
