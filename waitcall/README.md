# WaitCall for Gnokoii v0.1This little project is mostly a proof of concept or a prototype.Last updated on 2008-09-17 and implemented in C.## DescriptionThis is a very simple application based on gnokii library,  based on "waitcall" gnokii sample by Daniele Forsi.It can execute commands on incoming call from authorized numbers.Related Links:	* http://www.gnokii.org/	## Requirements* (supported) Mobile phone (GSM) connected with PC.* QT Libraries (suggested 4.1 or later)* Gnokii libraries (0.6.26 or later)
## ScenarioRun application as deamon mode on a NIX system with a GSM phone and Gnokii installed.Make a call to pc-phone. When caller is enabled, application will run a script/program (see config).Application will also (by default) hang up call (so you don't wast money). Of course will wait for another call.## Building* Run "qmake", it will generate a Makefile.* Run "make"* Execute "waitcall --verbose"
## FAQs* to Kill daemon  As root execute "ps -A | grep waitcall", so you got its PID, now you can kill with "kill <PID_VALUE>"  If it doesn't work you can force using this option: "kill -KILL <PID_VALUE>"* Config and Log Files  By default it's created (loaded) in same directory.  You can override settings in configuration or with command line arguments.
* Gnokii or my phone seems to disconnect sometimes.. actually only solution is to disconnect and reconnect USB cable.
